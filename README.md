# 🚀 Cache Augmented Generation (CAG) - Supercharge Your LLM! 🧠⚡️

[![Streamlit App](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20App-Click%20Here-brightgreen)](YOUR_STREAMLIT_APP_LINK_HERE)

This project offers two implementations of Cache Augmented Generation (CAG), designed to drastically improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by pre-caching your knowledge base! Say goodbye to slow response times and hello to lightning-fast answers! ⚡️

## ✨ About

Cache Augmented Generation is a powerful technique that boosts the speed and efficiency of LLMs. By pre-computing and storing relevant information, CAG bypasses the need for real-time data retrieval, leading to significantly faster response times and a simplified system architecture.

## 📁 Files

*   `app.py`: Streamlit web application for interactive use. 🌐
*   `CAG.py`: Command-line interface for local testing. 💻
*   `Extinct Animals.pdf`: (Example PDF) Document with details on 20 extinct animals used for local testing with `CAG.py`. 🦖
*   `history.json`: JSON file to store questions and answers generated by `CAG.py`. 📜
*   `CLI-img.png`: Image showing the CLI interface (CAG.py). 🖼️

## 💻 `app.py`: Streamlit Web Application

`app.py` provides a user-friendly web interface to harness the power of CAG!

Features include:

*   **Upload Your Knowledge!** 📁: Supports `.pdf` and `.docx` files. Turn your documents into a super-fast knowledge base!
*   **Model Choice!** 🧠: Select from various available models (llama-3.1-8b-instant, gemma2-9b-it, qwen-qwq-32b).
*   **API Key Magic!** ✨: Provide your Groq API key for authentication.
*   **History in Your Hands!** 📜: Download your entire conversation history in a convenient JSON format.

**Important**: Keep in mind that CAG shines with documents that fit within the context window token size of your chosen model! For massive documents, try breaking them down or summarizing them first!

## ⌨️ `CAG.py`: Command-Line Interface

`CAG.py` allows you to experience the benefits of CAG right in your terminal!

Features:

*   **Colorful Fun!** 🌈: Uses `colorama` for a visually appealing and easy-to-read output.
*   **Local Knowledge!** 📚: Comes with the `Extinct Animals.pdf` file, pre-loaded with juicy details about 20 extinct animals!
*   **Ask Away!** 💬: An infinite loop lets you ask question after question until you type "exit."
*   **Keep Track of Your Thoughts!** 📝: All questions and answers are saved to a `history.json` file.
*   **Time is of the Essence!** ⏱️: See exactly how long each answer takes to generate!

### Example

```
python CAG.py
```

{
"model": [
{
"question": "What type of data this document contains?",
"answer": "This document contains factual, descriptive data about various extinct animals. The data includes:\n1. Extinction status (Gone Extinct)\n2. Time period of extinction (in millions of years ago or in modern era dates)\n3. Scientific name or common name of the animal\n4. Description of the animal's physical characteristics, abilities, and behaviors\n5. Information about its habitat, diet, and prey\n6. Cause of extinction (climate change, overhunting, competition, etc.)\n\nOverall, the document appears to be a reference or encyclopedia-style compilation of information about extinct animals. It seems to be providing educational or informative content about these fascinating creatures."
