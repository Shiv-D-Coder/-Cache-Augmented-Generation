# Cache Augmented Generation (CAG)

This project provides two implementations of Cache Augmented Generation (CAG): a Streamlit app for general use and a command-line interface (CLI) for local testing.

## Overview

Cache Augmented Generation is a technique to improve the performance of Language Models (LLMs) by caching the knowledge base. This project leverages precomputed Key-Value (KV) caches to streamline inference, offering faster response times and reduced system complexity compared to traditional approaches.

## Files

*   `app.py`: Streamlit web application for interactive use.
*   `CAG.py`: Command-line interface for local testing.
*   `Extinct Animals.pdf`: (Example PDF) Document with details on 20 extinct animals used for local testing with `CAG.py`.
*   `history.json`: JSON file to store questions and answers generated by `CAG.py`.

## `app.py`: Streamlit Web Application

`app.py` is a Streamlit application designed for users to interact with the CAG model through a web interface. This version allows users to:

*   **Upload Documents**: Supports uploading `.pdf` and `.docx` files as the knowledge base.
*   **Choose Model**: Select from various available models (llama-3.1-8b-instant, gemma2-9b-it, qwen-qwq-32b).
*   **Enter API Key**: Provide the Groq API key for authentication.
*   **Download History**: Download the conversation history in a JSON format.

**Note**: CAG works best with documents that fit within the context window token size of the chosen model. For very large documents, consider using techniques like document chunking or summarization before uploading.

## `CAG.py`: Command-Line Interface

`CAG.py` provides a command-line interface (CLI) to test the CAG model locally. It includes the following features:

*   **Coloroma**: Utilizes the `colorama` library for colored output, enhancing readability.
*   **Local PDF**: It uses `Extinct Animals.pdf` for the knowledge base. This file contains details about 20 extinct animals.
*   **Interactive Queries**: Allows users to ask questions in an infinite loop until "exit" is typed.
*   **JSON History**: Saves all questions and answers to a `history.json` file for future reference.
*   **Response Time**: Calculates and displays the time taken to generate each answer.

### Example Usage

To run `CAG.py`, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed and set up your environment variables. Then, execute the script:

```
python CAG.py
```
You can find saved qus and ans in history.json file.

```
{
"model": [
    {
    "question": "When did the dodo go extinct?",
    "answer": "The dodo (Raphus cucullatus) went extinct in the late 17th century due to overhunting and habitat destruction."
    }
]
}
```
